## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent Information Technology Engineer graduate from **Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)** with a deep passion for AI research. My focus is on **multimodal deep learning** and **generative AI**, with the goal of building intelligent systems that can understand and integrate complex, diverse data.

My current research explores the exciting intersection of AI and life sciences, specifically applying **AI for DNA sequence analysis** and using **generative models for molecular design**.

I have hands-on experience developing end-to-end deep learning models, resulting in two submitted research publications in financial and biomedical AI. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities as an **AI/ML Engineer** where I can apply my skills to solve challenging real-world problems.
